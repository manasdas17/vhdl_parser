Aurochs version of VHDL port parser.

Aurochs is a PEG parser generator.  For more info see: http://aurochs.fr/

The purpose is to compare this with the C++ boost::spirit verison in the main directory.
This parser is actually much more complete than the boost::spirit version.

To build: 

> make

To run the simple test:

> ./parse_vhdl.native


Or if you have Aurochs installed on your system you can try the following:

> aurochs -parse ../port_test.vhd vhdl.peg


Commentary:

With Aurochs you define a peg file that contains your grammar (vhdl.peg in this case) and you designate
various nodes that you're interested in like so: <NodeOfInterest>...</NodeOfInterest>

The parser then generates an AST with your designated nodes and you have to walk that tree to
do interesting things with it.  This means that semantic actions are completely separate from 
the grammar... that can be an advantage.  

One problem I see so far is that when there is a parse error it doesn't tell you the line that
error occurs on, it gives you a character count.  It's possible (probable) that I'm missing something
here, so I'm not saying that Aurochs can't do this only that I haven't figured it out yet.
Also, I haven't quite figured out Aurochs' error handling philosophy - it could be that you 
are on your own for that.

Overall, though, I've made a lot more progress on this version than I did with the boost::spirit
version.  Trying to figure out the template error messages that spirit produces when it's not
happy can be daunting.
